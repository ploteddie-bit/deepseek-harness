# schedule/ — Session-local reminders

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Ask the agent to remind you later, at an absolute time, on a fixed interval, or on a calendar schedule, and the reminder arrives as an ordinary message in the same conversation when it comes due. Reminders survive restarts but stay inside the session: there is no email, SMS, or push notification. Optional browser surfaces list the active reminders and mark conversations that have some, from cached state rather than a live guarantee. This page maps the group; each package README owns its contract.
